# Cancer-Survival-Insights-An-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

This project presents an exploratory and inferential data analysis of a global cancer dataset to identify key factors affecting patient survival, disease severity, and treatment outcomes. The analysis focuses on how demographics, genetic and lifestyle risk factors, environmental exposure, clinical characteristics, and treatment costs influence cancer outcomes.


Using statistical analysis and data visualization, the project explores early-stage vs late-stage diagnoses, identifies predictors of survival years, analyzes economic burden across countries and demographics, and assesses whether higher treatment costs are associated with longer survival. The goal is to convert raw healthcare data into clear, evidence-based insights for data-driven decision-making.

### Tools & Techniques:
